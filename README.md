# spotify_api

This repository id dedicated to learning the basics of working with API and JSON files.
There are two main python programs in total: first - artist_info.py and marlets_map_app.py that both
work with Spotify API.


1. artist_info.py - main task of this program is to manipulate and navigate
through different parts of json file. Program takes input - artist's name, and returns
list of top 10 songs of the artist, album's year of release, album's name and, 
additionally, artist's id.
